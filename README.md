Respect\Relational
==================

A tool for any relational database that grows complex according to your needs.

This package is composed of the following components:

 * **Sql**, an abstraction of the SQL Language Syntax.
 * **Db**, a simple database toolkit.
 * **Mapper**, an ORM.

Mapper
------

The Mapper itself relies on different *Schema Providers*:

 * **Infered** infers entity information from naming conventions
 * **ReverseEngineered** extract entity information from the database itself
   (through clauses like `SHOW TABLES`)
 * **Reflected** extract entity information from PHP classes

These schemas have different levels of complexity, and you can migrate from a
simpler to a more complex schema seamlessly.

For example, you can start with the *Infered* Schema Provider that requires
zero-configuration and migrate to a *ReverseEngineered* Schema Provider
later, which has less limitations (but requires more configuration).

### The Infered Schema Provider (implemented)

This is the only provider that require database naming conventions:

 * Each table must have a single primary key named `id`
 * Each foreign key must be `table_id`
 * Each N-to-N table must be `table_othertable`

Samples:

  * post (id, title, text)
  * comment (id, post_id, name, text)
  * category (id, name)
  * post_category (id, post_id, category_id)

Usage sample:

    <?php
    use PDO;
    use Respect\Relational\Mapper;
    use Respect\Relational\Db;
    use Respect\Relational\Schemas\Infered;

    $mapper = new Mapper(new Db(new PDO('my_sqlite.sq3')), new Infered());

    $commentsFromPost12 = $mapper->comment->post[12]->fetchAll();
    $categoriesFromPost7 = $mapper->category->category_post->post[7]->fetchAll();

    $post3 = $mapper->post[3]->fetch();
    $post3->title = 'Hey!';

    $mapper->persist($post3);
    $mapper->flush();

### The ReverseEngineered Provider (not implemented yet)

This SP doesn't have the limitations of the above:

  * You can have any table and column names
  * You can have composite primary keys
  * You can have multiple foreign keys to the same table on the same origin

Configuration needed:

  * Cache implementation for the metadata retrieved
  * Abstraction of the metadata provider

More info soon...

### The Reflected Provider (not implemented yet)

This schema allows you to:

  * Use abstracted classes to specify single table inheritance
  * Use concrete classes to specify class table inheritance
  * Use method parameters to specify value objects

Configuration needed:

  * Classes for each one of the entities
  * Cache implementation for Reflection data

SQL (implemented)
---

You don't need to write SQL to use Respect\Relational, but if you *do want* to
write SQL, we provide a great tool for that. The SQL language is a first-class
citizen on our project, even if it runs just on the internal stuff.

The *Sql* class were created just to overcome the most annoying problems of
writing SQL:

 * Concatenate values
 * Optional conditions on `WHERE` clauses
 * Functions inside SQL clauses

Writing SQL on Respect\Relational is something like this:

    <?php
    use Respect\Relational\Sql;

    $conditions = array(
        'foo' => 'bar',
        'MD5(password)' => 'd1d1d1d1d1d1d1d1d1d'
    );
    $sql = Sql::select('my_column', 'my_column_2')
              ->from('my_table')
              ->where($conditions)
              ->orderBy('my_column DESC');
              ->limit(5,10);

Relational\Sql will create the query and parse the parameters (avaliable
on `$sql->getParams()`). If you pass an empty `$conditions` array, the `WHERE`
clause isn't even created.

Parameters, functions and everthing also works on `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
or any other clause. In fact, our implementation allows you to use clauses that
weren't even known by our developers, because we've abstracted the language
syntax, not its grammar.

    //EXPLODE DINOSAUR ted USING tnt
    Sql::explodeDinosaur('ted')->using('tnt');

Db (implemented)
--

The Respect\Relational\Db tool is the most simple direct interaction with
a database you could think of. It allows you to do thinks like this:

    <?php
    use PDO;
    use Respect\Relational\Db;

    $db = new Db(new PDO('my_sqlite.sq3'));
    $conds = array('foo'=>'bar');
    $myObjects = $db->select('*')->from('my_table')->where($conds)->fetchAll();

The `$conds` array is automatically parsed, the SQL is prepared and the statement
is executed with the correct parameters.
