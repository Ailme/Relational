Respect\Relational
==================

Fluent ORM

Quintessential sample
---------------------

Tables used:

  * author (id, name)
  * post (id, author_id, title, text)
  * comment (id, post_id, author_id, text)

PHP:

    <?php
    use PDO;
    use Respect\Relational\Mapper;

    $mapper = new Mapper(new PDO( /* my db conf */ ));

    $postTwelve = $mapper->post[12]->fetch();
    $commentsOnPostTwelve = $mapper->comment->post[12]->fetchAll();
    $commentsOnPostsFromAuthorSeven = $mapper->comment->post->author[7]->fetchAll();

Thats it. It doesn't need configuration, entity classes or anything else. *Plug
and rock on*.

Nice, but how it works?
-----------------------

If you're wondering how dirty are the SQL statements generated, well, they're 
pretty readable and smart. The last sample above generate something like this:

    SELECT
        *
    FROM 
        comment
    INNER JOIN
        post
        ON comment.post_id = post.id
    INNER JOIN
        author
        ON comment.author_id = author.id
    WHERE
        author.id = 7;

Seems written by a human, doesn't? The mapper is able to treat duplicated columns, 
human readable joins and everything else without any configuration or extra SQL
statements. It **does not** use `SHOW TABLES` or anything like it by default, 
but you can use it if you want.

More samples
------------

Edit a post:

    $post = $mapper->post[12]->fetch();
    $post->title = "New Post title";
    $mapper->persist($post);
    $mapper->flush();

New comment:

    $comment = new stdClass;
    $comment->post_id = 3;   //you can use a post object if you want
    $comment->author_id = 7; //same here
    $comment->text = "hi there";
    $mapper->persist($comment);
    $mapper->flush();
    
Edit a bunch of comments:

    $comments = $mapper->comment->author[15]->fetchAll();

    foreach ($comments as $c) {
        $c->text = "This user has been banned";
        $mapper->persist($c);
    }

    $mapper->flush();

Remove a previously fetched comment:

    $comment = $mapper->comment[1651]->fetch();
    $mapper->remove($comment);
    $mapper->flush();

Last 10 comments from author (full code):

    <?php
    use PDO;
    use Respect\Relational\Mapper;
    use Respect\Relational\Sql;

    $mapper = new Mapper(new PDO( /* my db conf */ ));

    $lastComments = $mapper->comment
                           ->author[15]
                           ->fetchAll(Sql::orderBy('id desc')->limit(10));

Use entity classes (full code):

    <?php
    use PDO;
    use Respect\Relational\Mapper;
    use Respect\Relational\Sql;
    use Respect\Relational\SchemaDecorators\Typed;
    use Respect\Relational\Schemas\Infered;

    $schemaProvider = new Typed(new Infered, 'MyNamespace\\Entities');
    $mapper = new Mapper(new PDO( /* my db conf */ ), $schemaProvider);

    $lastComments = $mapper->comment
                           ->author[15]
                           ->fetchAll(Sql::orderBy('id desc')->limit(10));

Entity classes must have public attributes, like this:

    <?php

    namespace MyNamespace\\Entities;

    class Comment 
    {
        public $id;
        public $author_id;
        public $post_id;
        public $text;
    }

Roadmap
-------

  * New Schema Providers:
    * ReverseEngineered (from metadata tables)
    * Config (from configuration)
    * Reflected (extract schema info from PHP objects)
    * DoctrineAnnotation (from Doctrine Annotations)
    * AutoGenerated (creates and alters the tables itself, without configuration)
  * New Schema Decorators:
    * Cached (cache metadata for some schema providers)
    * LazyLoaded (less joins, more small queries)
  * Table inheritance (abstract for single table and concrete for multi table)
  * Support for value objects
