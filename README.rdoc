== About

Respect\Relational is a package composed by two simple utilities for relational databases:

* Relational\Sql, an abstraction of the SQL _syntax_, not the SQL commands.
* Relational\Db, simple toolkit for using Relational\Sql in PDO connections

== Abstraction of the SQL _syntax_? WTF?

Instead of abstracting commands (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE), Relational\Sql steps down 
one level to abstract the general syntax of the language itself. It's lightweight, simple 
to use, fast and powerful.

Samples:

Pure SQL:
	SELECT * FROM table
Relational\Sql:
	$sql->select('*')->from('table');


Pure SQL:
	SELECT DISTINCT * FROM table WHERE column=123
Relational\Sql:
	$sql->selectDistinct('*')->from('table')->where('column=123');

Pure SQL (prepared statement):
	SELECT column, MAX(def) FROM table WHERE abc=:Abc GROUP BY abc, def HAVING SUM(abc)>10 AND AVG(def)=:AvgDef
Relational\Sql:
        $where = array('abc' => 10);
        $having = array('SUM(abc)>10', 'AVG(def)' => 15);
	$sql->select('column', 'MAX(def)')->from('table')->where($where)->groupBy('abc', 'def')->having($having);
